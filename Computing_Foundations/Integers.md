## Integer Types <a name="section1"></a>

The following portable integer types are defined by the [stdint.h][STDINT] header file standardized by  *POSIX.1-2017* which is equivalent to *IEEE Std 1003.1-2017* and *The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 edition*. 

| Std Type     | C Type             | Bits |                   Range  (MIN .. MAX)                   |
| :----------- | :----------------- | :--: | :-----------------------------------------------------: |
| **uint8_t**  | unsigned char      |  8   |                        0 .. 255                         |
| **int8_t**   | char               |  8   |                       -128 .. 127                       |
| **uint16_t** | unsigned short/int |  16  |                       0 .. 65'535                       |
| **int16_t**  | short/int          |  16  |                    -32'768 .. 32'767                    |
| **uint32_t** | unsigned int/long  |  32  |                   0 .. 4'294'967'295                    |
| **int32_t**  | int/long           |  32  |             -2'147'483'648 .. 2'147'483'647             |
| **uint64_t** | unsigned long long |  64  |             0 .. 18'446'744'073'709'551'615             |
| **int64_t**  | long long          |  64  | -9'223'372'036'854'775'808 .. 9'223'372'036'854'775'807 |

The size of the C types `unsigned int`, `int`, `unsigned long` and `long` depends on the processor architecture (16, 32 or 64 bit). Therefore if exact size is an issue, the use of the standard types is strongly recommended.

## Binary Addition <a name="section2"></a>

The ASCII graphics below shows the binary addition of the two `uint8_t` numbers `x = 70` and `y = 50`  resulting in `z = 120`.
```  <!-- language: lang-none -->
    7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0    binary digit index
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  carry bits
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |  x = 70
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |  y = 50
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  z = x + y = 120
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```
Next we add the two `uint8_t` numbers `x = 255` and `y = 1` causing an overflow.
```  <!-- language: lang-none -->
    7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0    binary digit index
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |  carry bits
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |  x = 255
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |  y = 1
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  z = x + y mod 256 = 0
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```
Since the carry bit generated by the addition of the most-significant bits with index `7` that indicates an *overflow* is discarded, a modulo `2^N` operation with `N = 8` bits takes place so that `z = 256 mod 256 = 0` results.

**Python 1**: <a name="python1"></a>In the following  examples we explore the cyclic overflow behaviour of the standard **unsigned** integer types by using the Python `ctypes` library.

We add the two `uint8_t` numbers `x = 70` and `y = 50` resulting in `z = 120`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_uint8(70)
>>> y = c_uint8(50)
>>> z = c_uint8()
>>> format(x.value, '08b')
'01000110'
>>> format(y.value, '08b')
'00110010'
>>> z.value = x.value + y.value
>>> format(z.value, '08b')
'01111000'
>>> print(z)
c_ubyte(120)
```

We cause an overflow by adding `1` to an `uint8_t` set to `UINT8_MAX`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_uint8(255)       # uint8_t set to UINT8_MAX
>>> y = c_uint8(1)
>>> z = c_uint8()
>>> format(x.value, '08b')
'11111111'
>>> format(y.value, '08b')
'00000001'
>>> z.value = x.value + y.value
>>> format(z.value, '08b')
'00000000'
>>> print(z)
c_ubyte(0)
```
We cause an underflow by subtracting `1` from an `uint16_t` set to `0`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_uint16()          # uint16_t set to 0
>>> print(x)
c_ushort(0)                 # uint16_t maps to an unsigned short
>>> x.value -= 1
>>> print(x)
c_ushort(65535)
>>> format(x.value, '#06x')
'0xffff'
```
We cause an overflow by adding `10` to an `uint32_t` set to `UINT32_MAX`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_uint32(0xffffffff)  # uint32_t set to UINT32_MAX
>>> print(x)
c_uint(4294967295)            # uint32_t maps to an unsigned int
>>> x.value += 10
>>> print(x)
c_uint(9)
```
We cause an overflow by squaring an `uint64_t` set to `2^32`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_uint64(0x100000000) # uint64_t
>>> print(x)
c_ulong(4294967296)           # uint64_t maps to an unsigned long
>>> x.value *= x.value
>>> print(x)
c_ulong(0)
```

## Endianness <a name="section3"></a>

A 32 bit word used to store an unsigned or signed integer (`uint32_t` or `int32_t`, respectively) comprises  four ordered bytes of memory:
``` <!-- language: lang-none -->
word32 = byte3 * 2^24  +  byte2 * 2^16  +  byte1 * 2^8  +  byte0
```
`byte0` is the Least Significant Byte (LSB) and `byte3` is the Most Significant Byte (MSB). On computer platforms there are two fundamentally different ways how these bytes are addressed in memory:

**Big-Endian**
``` <!-- language: lang-none -->
addr      addr+1    addr+2    addr+3
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
|  byte3  |  byte2  |  byte1  |  byte0  |
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
  MSB                            LSB
```
*Big-endian* order is equivalent to *network order* where the MSB byte is transmitted first over a network connection and the LSB last.  Thus if a *big-endian* 32 bit word starts at address `addr` in memory then the MSB can be retrieved at  the word address `addr` and the LSB with an offset of 3 bytes at `addr+3`.

**Little-Endian**
``` <!-- language: lang-none -->
addr      addr+1    addr+2    addr+3
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
|  byte0  |  byte1  |  byte2  |  byte3  |
+---------+---------+---------+---------+
  LSB                            MSB
```
If a *little-endian* 32 bit word is stored at address `addr` in memory then the LSB can be retrieved at  the word address `addr` and the MSB with an offset of 3 bytes at `addr+3`. If a *little-endian* multi-byte word has to be sent over a network connection in binary format then usually a conversion from *host order* to *network order* has to take place on the transmitting side and probably a conversion back to *host order* on the receiving side. The standard C library offers the following conversion functions:
``` c
uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);

uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong);
uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort);
```
All Intel, AMD  and RISC-V processors are *little-endian* whereas most ARM and Power PC processors are *bi-endian*, i.e. they can be configured by a software switch to work either in *big-endian* or *little-endian* mode.

**Python 2**: <a name="python2"></a>By using `ctypes` address pointers and the` ctypes` cast mechanism, we try to get at the individual bytes of word structures

We access the individual bytes of a `uint16_t` word and see that the storage order is *little-endian*. By exchanging LSB and MSB the `uint16_t` word is converted from *host order* to *network order*.
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> uint16_p = POINTER(c_uint16)    # define uint16_t pointer type
>>> uint8_p = POINTER(c_uint8)      # define uint8_t  pointer type
>>> x = c_uint16(0xaabb)            # set uint16_t word to 0xaabb
>>> x_addr = addressof(x)           # get memory address of x
>>> hex(x_addr)
'0x7f513d85ac48'                    # 48 bit memory address of x
>>> x16_p = cast(x_addr, uint16_p)  # cast address to uint16_t pointer
>>> hex(x16_p[0])                   # get first and only uint16_t array element
'0xaabb'
>>> x8_p = cast(x_addr, uint8_p)    # cast address to uint8_t pointer
>>> hex(x8_p[0])                    # get first uint8_t array element
'0xbb'                              # LSB is output
>>> hex(x8_p[1])                    # get second uint8_t array element
'0xaa'                              # MSB is output
>>> tmp = x8_p[0]                   # put LSB into temporary storage
>>> x8_p[0] = x8_p[1]               # MSB and LSB exchange positions
>>> x8_p[1] = tmp                   # conversion to network order completed
>>> hex(x16_p[0])
'0xbbaa'                            # LSB and MSB are not in host order anymore
```

We access the individual bytes of a `uint32_t` word and again *Little-Endianness* is observed.
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> uint8_p = POINTER(c_uint8)      # define uint8_t  pointer type
>>> x = c_uint32(0xaabbccdd)        # set uint32_t word to 0xaabbccdd
>>> x_addr = addressof(x)           # get memory address of x
>>> hex(x_addr)
'0x7f0a21408c48'                    # 48 bit memory address of x
>>> x_addr = addressof(x)           # take storage address of x
>>> hex(x_addr)                     # storage address of x
'0x7f0a21408c48'
>>> x8_p = cast(x_addr, uint8_p)    # cast address to uint8_t pointer
>>> hex(x8_p[0])                    # get first uint8_t array element
'0xdd'                              # LSB is output
>>> hex(x8_p[1])                    # get second uint8_t array element
'0xcc'
>>> hex(x8_p[2])                    # get third uint8_t array element
'0xbb'
>>> hex(x8_p[3])                    # get fourth uint8_t array element
'0xaa'                              # MSB is output
```
The same happens when accessing the individual bytes of an `uint64_t`
```python
from ctypes import *
>>> uint8_p = POINTER(c_uint8)
>>> x = c_uint64(0x11223344aabbccdd)
>>> x_addr = addressof(x)
>>> >>> hex(x_addr)
'0x7f1740f59c48'
>>> x8_p = cast(x_addr, uint8_p)
>>> [hex(x8_p[i]) for i in range(0, 8)]
['0xdd', '0xcc', '0xbb', '0xaa', '0x44', '0x33', '0x22', '0x11']
```

## Two's Complement <a name="section4"></a>

The representation of *negative* or *signed* numbers is a non-trivial task. Instead of keeping a separate *sign flag* to differentiate between positive and negative numbers, electronic computers use the [two's complement][NEG_NUM] to encode negative numbers.

The two's complement of an `N`-bit number is defined as its complement with respect to `2^N`. For instance with `N = 4`,  the two's complement of the four-bit number `0010` (+2) is `1110` (-2), because `0010 + 1110 = 10000` (16).  Since the carry bit for the most-significant bit of an `N`-bit number is discarded after an addition, which is equivalent to a modulo `2^N` operation,  `10000 mod 2^N` equals `0000`.

![Cyclic Addition][NEG_NUM_IMG]

**Two's Complement Rule**: `-x = ~x + 1` The negative value `-x` of a number `x` in binary two's complement representation is computed by *bitwise* inversion of `x` and then adding `1` to the inverted value.

Thus the bit inversion of  `0010` (+2)  results in `1101` (-3) and by adding `1` gives the final value of  `1110` (-2). A special case is zero with its representation of `0000` that gets inverted to `1111` (-1) and by adding `1` becomes `0000` again.

Graphically the negation of a number can be interpreted as mirroring the circle position of `x` on the horizontal axis (thick blue line in the picture above) and then rotating the flipped value `~x` by one position on the circle counter-clockwise.

Generally *addition* by one is equivalent to a counter-clockwise rotation of the number position on the circle whereas *subtraction* by one translates into a clockwise rotation. 

When the largest representable *positive* value is exceeded during addition, an *overflow* occurs and the result takes on the largest representable *negative* value. E.g. adding `1` to  `0111` (+7) results in `1000` (-8).

It is also evident from the figure above that the most-significant bit of a negative number in two's complement representation is always set to `1`.

[NEG_NUM]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement
[NEG_NUM_IMG]: Twos_Complement_400.png "Cyclic Addition"

**Python 3**: <a name="python3"></a>In the following  examples we explore the cyclic overflow behaviour of the standard **signed** integer types by using the Python `ctypes` library.

We cause an overflow by adding `1` to an `int8_t` set to `INT8_MAX`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_int8(0b01111111)       # int8_t set to INT8_MAX
>>> print(x)
c_byte(127)
>>> x.value += 1
>>> print(x)
c_byte(-128)
```
We cause an underflow by subtracting `1` from an `int16_t` set to `INT16_MIN`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_int16(0x8000)          # int16_t set to INT16_MIN
>>> print(x)
c_short(-32768)                  # int16_t maps to a short
>>> x.value -= 1
>>> print(x)
c_short(32767)
```
We  add an`int32_t` set to `INT32_MAX` and an `int32_t` set to `INT32_MIN` to each other
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x_max = c_int32(0x7fffffff)  # int32_t set to INT32_MAX
>>> x_min = c_int32(0x80000000)  # int32_t set to INT32_MIN
>>> print(x_max)
c_int(2147483647)                # int32_t maps to an int
>>> print(x_min)
c_int(-2147483648)
>>> y = c_int32()
>>> y.value = x_max.value + x_min.value
>>> print(y)
c_int(-1)
```
We add `INT64_MIN = -2^63` to an `int64_t`value set to `2^62`
```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_int64(1 << 62)         # int64_t
>>> print(x)
c_long(4611686018427387904)      # int64_t maps to a long
>>> x.value += (1 << 63)
>>> print(x)
c_long(-4611686018427387904)
```

## Binary Subtraction <a name="section5"></a>

On an electronic computer the binary [subtraction][SUB_NUM] `z = x - y` is implemented by adding the two's complement `-y` of the *minuend* `y` to the *subtrahend* `x` resulting in the *difference* `z`.
```  <!-- language: lang-none -->
    7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0    binary digit index
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  carry bits
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  x = 120
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    -
  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |  y =  50
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | -y = -50
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |  z = x + (-y) = 70
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```
**Python 4**: <a name="python4"></a>We show that binary substraction is equivalent to binary addition of the minuend's two's complement.

```python
>>> from ctypes import *
>>> x = c_uint8(120)
>>> y = c_uint8(50)
>>> ym = c_uint8(-50)             # set two's complement -y
>>> z = c_uint8()
>>> format(x.value, '08b')
'01111000'
>>> format(y.value, '08b')
'00110010'
>>> format(ym.value, '08b')
'11001110'                        # two's complement of y
>>> z.value = x.value - y.value   # subtraction of y
>>> print(z)
c_ubyte(70)
>>> z.value = x.value + ym.value  # addition of -y
>>> print(z)
c_ubyte(70)
```
